# Document your project with Markdown, Sphinx, and Read the Docs

> Let's be honest: we like the projects we use to be well-documented, but we
> almost never have time to document ours. How can we make writing
> documentation for our Data Science project be as pleasant as possible?
>
> In this workshop you will document a Data Science project using Sphinx,
> leveraging Markdown and Jupyter notebooks, and we will deploy the result to
> Read the Docs.
